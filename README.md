# ACM Tasks
These tasks were given to me as part of the recruitment process of BITS ACM Chapter.

Duplicate file finder
A python program that uses a hashmap to find and store duplicates in a target directory.
Target directory(s) are fed as command line arguements to the program.
A list of common files is displayed and user inputs the files to be deleted.
Since, this was built in a short time,exceptions are not handled and code is not robust by any standards.

Percolation
A Monte Carlo Engine which estimates the Percolation Threshold.
